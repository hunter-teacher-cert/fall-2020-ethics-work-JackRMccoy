    <h1>The New England Patriots - To Tank or not to Tank?</h1>
    <p>The New England patriots, led by <abbr title = "Super Man">Cam Newton</abbr>, find themselves in dangerous territory, starring at the potential of being worse than bad; mediocre.  There is a special place for those NFL franchises that find a way to win just enough games to keep them from a high draft position, yet not enough games to get them into the dance in January.  The Patriots are not currently mathematically eliminated from the knock out round, and yet they are still on the outside looking in.</p>

    <h2>To Tank</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Earn a higher draft pick - a better shot at younger talent to build for the future</li>
          <li>Spare the pain of an inevitable loss in the wild card round</li>
          <li>Use the later half of the season to give your young talent a chance to impress and build experience</li>
        </ul>

	<h2>Not To Tank</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Give Cam the shot he deserves</li>
          <li>In January ANYTHING can happen</li>
          <li>Every win is worthwhile</li>
        </ul>
