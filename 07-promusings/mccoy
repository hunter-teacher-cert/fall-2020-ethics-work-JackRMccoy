Ranked Short List of Topics for CS Ethics Project

1)	Environment – exploring the human impact and also waste effects associated with big-tech hardware really appeals to me.  The bbc article on the environmental effects of producing tech in China is heartbreaking.  It was also interesting to explore the energy usage and electricity consumption in relation to home use, but also the impact of big data processing and maintaining server farms was mindblowing.
2)	digital divide – Exploring those underserved populations in relation to current tech structures is also an interest of mine.  Especially with the rolling out of 5G and considering the vast numbers of people globally that do not have equal access.
3)	security vs convenience – The Electronic Frontier Foundation and the article on balancing convenience and security were also interesting to explore.  Celebrating multi-factor authentication and looking at how to better ensure your security and sacrificing some convenience very well may be worth it.
